Json in and out
---------------

JSON out is a realtively do-able approach - we shall define a method "todict"
on each SA object, and this shall be manually adjusted so that when it is called
it itself calls the same method on "children" objects.  THe presumed existence of children objects is fine for our current use cases.

SA appears not to give decent support to determining types of relationships - but this is so unlikely it is a matter of reading their docs more now.

In is a interesting matter - I intend to do the simple case of one json doc, one mapping (schema specific) and then setattr work.



Discussion on serialising rows
------------------------------

It used to be easy to serialise a database row.  Really.
But here we are really serialsing nested objects - and the dangers that allows
and the edge cases are aquite high.  I cannot find a simple clean and supported method to
arbitraily serialise SQ objects to dict (and on to JSON)

So, the best approach (and variations of this are around the
literature (you know, on the Blue Googles)) is to craft an extra
function in each SA object, that supports a serialisable function (probably __iter__)
and that function returns serialised data that we control

Pretty much exactly what I have been doing.

In short, there are ways to do this arbitrarily deep and recursive -
but the magic is deep in SA and I would worry about defending the edge
cases (

SA mindset - the SA mindset is (IMO) about solving the ORM bete-noir
of inheritence in relations/entites.  THat is if a professor and a
student both inherit from a person class, how is that handeled in the
database, and how to map that in the ORM. My feeling is not to do so.  However a lot of SA becomes easier to understand when you rembmer this and its iomplications.

Some notes:

sqlalchemy.ext.serializer exists to support pickling (with pickle
module) of queries, expressions and other internal SQLAlchemy objects,
it doesn't deal with model objects. In no way it will help you to
serialize model objects to XML.

Issues: repeating code - either use external calls or inherit
: we do not use jsonpickle - its very python specific - at least datetime transforms are ISOformat


usermodel.py
============

Represents the SQLALchemy classes and assoc functions, that store user
details in web server, and persist to postgres dbase.

We have two main models :py:class:User and :py:class:Identifier.
One User may have many identifiers, but one identifier may only have
one User.  Each identier is either a openid or a persona.

A user_id is a urn of form <domain_of_originating_repo>-<uuid(4)>
"org.cnx.user.f9647df6-cc6e-4885-9b53-254aa55a3383"


API

:/user/:
    Support POST PUT GET [DELETE]
    Is keyed on *user_id* - the uuid form above
    /user/org.cnx.user.f9647df6-cc6e-4885-9b53-254aa55a3383
    will return a *user profile* in JSON form

:/users/:
    Support only GET

:/users/:
    GET - will return list of all users - is only for dev. and
          hardcoded to max 25

:/users/?fullname=bob:
    GET - searches the key field in User object and returns
          JSON encoded user profiles


A specialised form of the above search is

/user/?openid=http://xxx
/user/?persona=p@x.com

These explicitly want to look up existing authetnitcatd identifiers in our dbase.
(ie part of signon process)


views
-----

:search_user():

:post_user(<dict>):
     user_id MUST NOT be present
     Will overwrite all fields provided.

:put_user(<dict>):
     user_id MUST be present.
     We will replace all fields provided

:get_user(<user_id>):
     IF search string present, treat it as a search
     else search_user

:search_user(authenticatedID):
     see above

:delete_user():
      TBD


Matching usermodel

Naming convention

distinguohs between a userprofile_dict and userprofile_json
                      identifier_dict and identifier_json


iterating over models

>>> x = [prop for prop in usermodel.User.__mapper__.iterate_properties if isinstance(prop, sqlalchemy.orm.properties.RelationshipProperty)]
>>> u.__getattribute__(x[0].key)
[<rhaptos2.user.usermodel.Identifier object at 0x8073dd890>]

This fails the smell test - a child object (relationship) has a relationship back to the parent - and no obvious way of determining the directionality or visted state (ie loops)
This is fair - parent child is only a common use case, nopt exclusive - but I want to deal with the common use case.
